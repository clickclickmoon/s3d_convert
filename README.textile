h1. s3d_convert

bq. An erlang module for packing and unpacking s3d archive files.

This is a tool for packing and unpacking resource archives for the EverQuest
client in it's .s3d file format.  The code is contained in a single module
with both two exported functions, unpack/1 and pack/1.  The pack/1 function
will take a folder name and create a single s3d file of that folder's contents
while the unpack/1 function does the oppsite, taking a filename of a .s3d file
and creating a folder containing the unpacked archive data.

The credit for this application really goes to WindCatcher on the EQEmu forums.

He figured out all of the details on how these files work and even provided an
application with sourcecode (S3DSpy) that would allow you to browse the archive
and look at the textures contained within.  S3DSpy was written in Delphi, which
is not a language I'm particularly fond of and have no intentions of using for
other projects in the future.  Also, I wanted to make a general module/library
for the s3d format.  Something I could use on the command line or in a Makefile
to package and unpack data easily.  Finally, I also needed to learn the details
and I've always though there is no better way to learn than to do.  So I did.

Thank you again to WindWatcher, all the EQEmu developers and contributors along
with the eqclassic project and it's collection of developers.

h2. s3d File Format

There are only two real data types that are needed internally to be able to 
work your way through an s3d file, a byte and an unsigned long int, or a four
byte unit.  All of the meta data (headers, CRCs, etc.) is handled with the 32
bit item and all of the file data is in single bytes, since they are variable
length.  It's easy to think of the file format as a simple file system.  While
talking about the file format I will use the term item for a 32 bit data object
and byte for a single byte.

h3. File Header

The first three items can be thought of as the file header.  It contains just a
little bit of data that seems to be consistant between files.  The first item
is a pointer to another location in the file, which is very important.  The 
other two items are the constant header data that is the same between files.

h4. file_listing_offset

The first item in the file, this is a pointer to a location in the file.  The
data at the location this points to is the start of the file listing table. I
will go into greater detail about what exactly is at this location in a moment.

h4. pfs_string

The secong item is a 4 byte character string.  It is always 'PFS ' and within
the module it is just used as the number that it comes out as when read as a
32 bit int, 542328400.  This is used to identify the file as a "Packaged File
System" and it's checked when unpacking to be sure we are working with an s3d.

h4. file_flags

The last item in the header is somewhat of an unknown.  It does not appear to
change between files and is never referenced elsewhere in the file.  Given that
the number that this comes out to (131072) I suspect that this is a file flag
bit mask.  The truth may never be know, for now we just look for the known good
number and go with that.
